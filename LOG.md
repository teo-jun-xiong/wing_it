| Activity | Date | Time Spent (Jarryl) | Time Spent (Jun Xiong) | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Project idea meeting | 16 May | 3 | 3 | Brainstormed about possible problem motivations and discussed if they had extensive impact, and in the end, we felt that our current topic was the most relatable. Additionally, it felt like a unique and challenging idea to bring to fruition. |
| Android Studio familiarisation | 17 May | 2 | 2 | Recapped what went through during Liftoff, such as managing the layout of the app and exploring the various widgets and built-in capabilities Android Studio had to offer. |
| Kotlin e-learning | 19 May | 3 | 3 | Decided to program our Android app in Kotlin rather than the Java that we have been using for Year 1 as it was refreshing to utilise a new programming language. However, the IDE was overwhelming as compared to our experience using Java for CS2040 since we only used a simple text editor, VIM. |
| Kotlin familiarisation | 22 May | 1 | 1 | Fleshed out the core differences between Java and Kotlin by practising simple problem set questions. |
| Implementing initial features | 26 May | 4 | 4 | Watched various YouTube channels (Daniel Malone and more) to understand more on how to implement certain elements that were crucial for our app. Went on to debug a few problems that cropped up, namely the Calendar and splash screen. The splash screen took especially long as the tutorials provided code blocks that were difficult to interpret from a layman's perspective. |
Github | 28 May | 2 | 2 | Attempted to figure out how to use Github as a platform for us to collaborate without the need to meet up. We found out how to create branches and upload altered files to generate pull requests to merge with the master branch. However, encountered issues where syncing Git with Android Studio did not commit/ change the files in Github which was not yet resolved. |
| Milestone 1 submission | 2 June | 3 | 3 | Wrote the script for our video submission and recorded the voice-over. Used Canva to create the poster and Moqups for the mock-ups of our app. Then, we used Photos (Windows program) to make a simple video with the voice-over. Redid it as the quality was low, and ended up taking up more time. |
| Implementing navigation drawer | 4 June | 6 | 6 | Used CodingInFlowâ€™s 3 part video to understand how to create a Navigation Drawer activity from scratch, which included connecting the main activity to the multiple fragments. Also, learnt that the popup message is called a Toast, and it is fairly simple to implement. |
| Creating a navigable app | 5 June | 6 | 6 | Consolidated the past lessons and made an app that had a sliding menu, and 3 fragments, which were the core features for our project. Took a bit longer than expected because the tutorials were in Java, and we wanted to code it in Kotlin, at a juncture where we are wondering if we should change to Java as they are a lot more resources as compared to Kotlin. In the end of Milestone 2, we have decided to change to Java as it was a more familiar background compared to Kotlin. |
| Understanding the Travelling Salesman Problem | 12 June | 3 | 3 | Went to read up on the TSP upon Calvin's suggestion, but we come to a realisation that every day on a trip, it would usually begin from the place of accomodations, i.e. an AirBnb or a hotel. As such, we decided that the SSSP would be the more viable and correct algorithm. Decided to temporarily use Dijkstra's algorithm as the foundation of our algorithm. |
| Implementing Google Maps API | 16 June | 11 | 11 | Learnt how to implement Google Maps and its some functions, such as center and zoom. | 
| Storing user's input and converting into coordinates | 18 June | 8 | 8 | Read through a tutorial on how to use the Address and LatLng objects in the Google Maps API to store the user's text input and search for the most relevant location, and then store it as a pair of latitude and longitude in a LatLng object. |
| Attempt #1 at devising the SSSP algorithm | 20 June | 7 | 9 | We found out that there was a ```Location.distanceTo()``` method which returned the distance between 2 points on the map. However, an issue we encountered was that this was purely the physical distance between the points, disregarding any roads, mountains, or obstacles. Therefore, we had to decide on another way of finding the distance. |
| Reading up on using URL requests to obtain distance/ time information (JSON) | 22 June | 10 | 9 | Despite there being a clear documentation by Google, it was difficult to follow and obtain the needed results, this will be revisited again. |
| Time is more important than distance | 25 June | 8 | 7 | Realised that the distance factor was less significant that the time needed to traverse between 2 points as that is the most important part of a trip afterall, taking the fastest route to a point. This is especially so since we intend for users to be able to input the number of hours they intend to spend at a point of interest. Even though we have yet to implement the latter, being able to obtain the fastest route between 2 points will allow us to easily scale up and implement that. Similar to th previous activity, it required URL requests that was difficult to get our heads around. | 
| Understanding Github integration with Android Studio | 26 June | 8 | 8 | Needed to use Github so that we could easily port over our work from laptop to desktop, and between one another. Increasing the ease of accessibility to edit our codes anywhere we were to prevent any loss of ideas / solutions. Since Github was a very unfamiliar platform for us, it took us quite a while to understand the interface and how each of the functions were for. 
| Updating README and Project Log for Milestone 2 | 30 June | 12 | 12 | Reviewed current progress and updated README. Realised that we are not on track towards a Minimal Viable Product that we can be satisfied with, especially in terms of implementing the URL request handling. Most likely, this has to be pushed to after Milestone 2. Moreover, there is no UI design to speak of. We were able to update the README as we did the project at the same time, allowing for an easier updating of the README. | 
| Attempt #2 at devising SSSP algorithm | 7 July | 0 | 4 | Attempted to scale the previous extraction of the duration and distance from the JSON, for every point of interest. Faced an issue where we were unable to store the duration between every point and every other point in an adjacency matrix - every element in the matrix would be 0. Using print statements, it seems like the ordering of the task is not as intended. | 
| Reading up on Dyanmic Programming and TSP | 10 July | 5 | 3 | Realised Travelling Salesman Problem is what our scenario is, and had to ditch the initial SSSP train of thought. |
| Searching for TSP and implementing into app | 12 July | 8 | 6 | Searched for a suitable TSP algorithm, and integrated it into our current implementation of the app. Encountered an obstacle whereby we do not know how to make use of the algorithm to produce the desired solution. |
| Implementing RecyclerView as a container for LocationListActivity | 22 July | 12 | 12 | Implemented RecyclerView to hold the previously added locations, added a delete function as well, which removes the item, but does not remove it from the list that is passed to RouteView when the Generate button is clicked. (note: was busy due to a family member's hospitalisation) | 
| Cleaning up code | 25 July | 9 | 9 | Cleaned up clutter and made code more readable. |
| Designed and added app icon | 26 July | 5 | 3 | Thinking of an app icon that will symbolise our app's main feature |
| Meeting to plan UI and optimising usability | 26 July | 10 | 10 | To make the app more user friendly as well as making it as little bugs as we could with our current skillsets. |
| Beautified app | 27 July | 9 | 11 | Added nicer buttons, app background, cards, colours, and fonts. | 
| Milestone 3 Video | 28 July | 10 | 12 | Coming up with the script, the videoing of the app and the editing of the videos to make is more easier to understand the app's functionalities. |
